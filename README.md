<p align="center"><strong>An Automated AI Coding Approach for Autobiographical Memory Research</strong></p>

This repository is for the AI coding project at Con Amore, Aarhus University.

Here, we provide a guideline on how to fine-tune a GPT model to code autobiographical memories and test the model's performance.   
- The prompts used in our AI coding project can be found in the Word file 'AI coding_Supplemental Material.docx'(will be uploaded after the related research paper is published)  
- The Python code for executing the fine-tuning job and model performance evaluation can be found in the notebook files: 'AI_coding.ipynb'.


Before running the code:  
- First, export your OPENAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal as instructed on the OpenAI website: https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries.  
- Second, run the following commands in the terminal to install OpenAI and the required packages:

```bash

python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip 

pip install openai    

pip install -r install_packages.txt
```
